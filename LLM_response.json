Scientists have found that zooplankton, which are tiny little creatures that swim in the ocean, are a big favorite snack of these whales. In fact, they're so important that zooplankton hotspots, where there are lots of them, seem to be connected to areas where bowhead whales like to hang out during the summer. And it's not just zooplankton - other fish and creatures eat them too! It's all part of a big food chain that helps keep the Arctic ocean healthy and strong.",
